            <p><b>Social Sharing</b></p>

            <p>
              The Services might include options for social sharing and other embedded functionalities (like the Facebook "Like" button). These allow you to broadcast your activities on the Services to other platforms, and similarly, bring external actions into our Services. Utilizing these tools means you can share details with your contacts or a broader audience, based on the preferences you set both on our platform and on the platforms offering these sharing features.

            </p>

            <p><b>Advertising and Analytics</b></p>
            <p>
              We might permit third parties to display ads to you online and offer analytics services. These third parties can employ cookies, tracking pixels, and other tools to gather details about your interaction with our Services and other sites. Both GURUKUL NATION and these entities might use this data to, for instance, study and monitor user behaviour, gauge the appeal of specific content, serve tailored ads and content based on your preferences on our platform and elsewhere, and gain insights into your online actions.
            </p>

            <p>
              Additionally, either we or our data associates might gather, retain, and disseminate a distinct identifier linked to your mobile gadget. This is done to present you with personalized advertisements or content as you use apps or browse online, or to uniquely recognize you across various devices or browsers. To tailor these ads or content, we or our data partners might merge and share summarized or anonymized data that you've willingly provided or that we've collected, ensuring it doesn't explicitly identify you.
            </p>
            <p><b>Security Measures</b></p>

            <p>
              We implement measures to safeguard your data against unauthorized access, loss, or misuse.
